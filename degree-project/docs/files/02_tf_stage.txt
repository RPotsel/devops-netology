Initializing modules...

Initializing the backend...

Successfully configured the backend "s3"! Terraform will automatically
use this backend unless the backend configuration changes.

Initializing provider plugins...
- Reusing previous version of yandex-cloud/yandex from the dependency lock file
- Reusing previous version of hashicorp/template from the dependency lock file
- Using previously-installed yandex-cloud/yandex v0.89.0
- Using previously-installed hashicorp/template v2.2.0

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
terraform -chdir=demo-app workspace select stage || \
	terraform -chdir=demo-app workspace new stage

Workspace "stage" doesn't exist.

You can create this workspace with the "new" subcommand.
Created and switched to workspace "stage"!

You're now on a new, empty workspace. Workspaces isolate their state,
so if you run "terraform plan" Terraform will not see any existing state
for this configuration.
